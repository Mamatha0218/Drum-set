request5-08-2023 Reflection: 
today we have learned github microsoft application. it is a management.
Gitpod.io is a server in github. 
gitpod is like vs code we can store the codes. 
And we have learned front end. 
How the front end  works? 
the front end will send a API means a request to the middle ware. 
the middle ware will check the request and send to controller. 
the controller will takes the data from database  and server. 
in between the controller and database  driver acts as a bridge. 
with help of server and data it runs the code. 
the controller will sends the response to the front end. 
next we have experienced the test. 
we wrote operation of databases. difference between gitpot and gitpot. io. 
And questions. 
           Thank you
